# How to contribute

Feel free to submit pull requests for any updates you feel are necessary.
Once the project has been graded by Udacity, I will be happy to review and
accept PRs.

`git clone` the files to your local system and submit PRs as new branches from
`master`. Preferably, branch names should concisely indicate the
update/feature being provided. After reviewing a PR, I will merge the branch
into `master` to add your updates to the main game :-). Thanks!
