## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

### Cross-platform testing made possible by [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com)

BrowserStack is _really_ **awesome**. I find it really useful that the mobile
devices run on the same OS versions from when they shipped. I can therefore
see how a page looks with the browser features of the time, as opposed to
checking only viewport characteristics as is often the case with browser
developer tools.
I **strongly** encourage you to give BrowserStack a try. (They are _quite_
generous with open source projects :wink:.)
