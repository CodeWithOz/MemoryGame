## Instructions

The live demo above allows the game to be played without the local files.
You can `git clone` this repo to get the files locally.

### Gameplay

The goal of the game is to match all 16 cards with as few moves and in as little
time as possible. Click/tap a card to reveal its content, then click/tap
another card to see if it matches the revealed card. Unmatched cards will
hide their contents again.

## Dependencies

- [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) installed **_globally_** if it was not installed with your
  version of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (run `npx --version` at the command line to check)

### Cross-platform testing made possible by [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com)

BrowserStack is _really_ **awesome**. I find it really useful that the mobile
devices run on the same OS versions from when they shipped. I can therefore
see how a page looks with the browser features of the time, as opposed to
checking only viewport characteristics as is often the case with browser
developer tools.
I **strongly** encourage you to give BrowserStack a try. (They are _quite_
generous with open source projects :wink:.)
